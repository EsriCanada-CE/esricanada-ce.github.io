## Mission Statement

Our mission is to establish a crowd-sourced approach towards promoting a harmonious coexistence between human populations and urban wildlife, particularly the Canada Geese population on the Western University campus. Through community engagement, we aim to identify and address the negative impacts of geese behaviour on campus infrastructure and human safety, while protecting the well-being of the geese and their habitat. In addition, we endeavour to cultivate a shared sense of responsibility regarding the importance of urban wildlife conservation, empowering individuals and groups to take responsible action toward this goal. Our GEMINI (GEese MIght Not be nIce) dashboard serves as a tool to facilitate community participation in this endeavour.
