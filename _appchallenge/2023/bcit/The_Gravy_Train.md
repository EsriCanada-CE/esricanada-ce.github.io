## Mission Statement

In 2011, Vancouver City Council approved the Greenest City Action plan which outlines 10 goal areas to guide Vancouver towards becoming the greenest city in the world. The 7th goal for becoming a global leader in urban food systems was introduced with the target of increasing local food assets through community gardens. Community gardens play a vital role in strengthening our local food systems, as they provide access to fresh and local foods, increase community wellness and add green spaces to urban areas. Food systems are faced with widespread population growth and rapid urbanization, by bringing in community gardens we are ensuring underused urban areas are being utilized and increasing the resilience and sustainability of green spaces within Vancouver. 

As of 2020, the City of Vancouver has gone beyond their goal of having 3,340 food assets/plots, but what does that mean?  Urban Forage is designed for users to determine the locality of nearest community gardens and derive how many people a garden can feed within the local neighborhood. Community gardens are recognized for feeding their community but Urban Forage will help to visualize the pattern of where the gardens are able to feed the most and where more gardens are needed.
