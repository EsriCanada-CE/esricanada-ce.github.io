  <h1>Meet the teams for the ECCE App Challenge {{ page.year }}</h1>

  This year, a total of {{ numteams }} teams from ECCE schools across Canada completed the App Challenge.
  <br /><br />

  The source code and documentation for each team has been added to the <a href="{{ challenge_ghurl }}">GitHub repository</a> for the {{ year }} challenge.  Below you will find a profile for each of this year's teams, along with details about the team members and the apps that they created.  Included with each profile is a video presentation created by the team to promote and demonstrate their app, and links are provided to access live demonstrations of their applications.
