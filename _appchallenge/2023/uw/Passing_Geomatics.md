## Overview

Conservation-Go is game that, much like the phenom of Pokémon-Go back in 2016, Conservation-Go believes in connecting the community. Players can go out into their environment and identify species of animals and trees in their neighbourhood. By doing so they will earn points, and be added to online leaderboards. This encourages players tp explore green-spaces, document wildlife and vegetation, and learn more about the local ecology. Connect with like-minded individuals called 'Green Trainers', and charities that help communities preserve urban ecology. 

## Mission Statement
The Conservation-Go project aims to encourage the exploration of local ecology. An educational tool that helps Green Trainers learn about their neighborhood parks, and the Species Collector App that helps them 'catch' information. There is an abundance of green spaces within the GTA and beyond, much of which may not be known to young individuals. Much like how Pokémon-Go revolutionized interaction, discovery and community, the Conservation-Go journey aims to evoke similar feelings. In which community comes together to learn about their environmental surroundings, species, vegetation and take on initiatives that are relevant to them.
