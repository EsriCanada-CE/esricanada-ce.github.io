    bio: "I’m a student in the Advanced GIS Diploma program at the Centre of Geographic Sciences (COGS) in Lawrencetown, Nova Scotia. I graduated from Western University in 2017 with an undergraduate degree in Software Engineering. To me, GIS is an exciting combination of geography, programming, and data analysis that provides a unique perspective of the world around us. When I’m not working on maps, you can find me reading, cooking, stargazing or exploring the outdoors."

## Mission statement

Access to public green space has become a cornerstone of sustainable urban development.
Whether used to unwind on a nice day or as landmarks when giving directions to your home, green spaces provide both social and environmental benefits to the surrounding community<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>. While many Canadian cities are known for their picturesque parks and lush greenery, a recent article has highlighted the strain that urban growth is putting on green spaces<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>. The uncertainty regarding the future of Canadian green spaces has left many people wondering how green their community is.

Nova Scotia’s Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) is not only the fastest growing urban area in Atlantic Canada, but it was also recently rated the country’s seventh greenest city<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup>. In order to balance its growth and greenery, the HRM released the Halifax Green Network Plan in 2018 to promote the long-term sustainability of the region<sup>[4](#footnote4)</sup>. Among its proposals, this plan suggests establishing a standard minimum distance/travel time for residents to access local green spaces. Our goal is to help Haligonians determine whether their neighbourhood meets this green standard.

The Halifax Urban Green Space (HUGS) application is designed to connect Haligonians with their local green spaces in two meaningful ways. First, HUGS provides users with metrics that evaluate the quality of green spaces in their community. Second, the app locates and provides information on green space facilities within a user-defined radius. These features give users an indication of their community’s sustainability.
