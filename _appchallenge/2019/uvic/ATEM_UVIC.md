    bio: "My name is  Xi Sun, I came from China. After graduated as the master of Electronic Engineer, I had been a software developer for over 10 years.<br /><br />Currently, I am a second year graduate student supervised by Professor Coady Yvonne in computer science department of University of Victoria. My thesis direction is the collaboration of Augmented reality in the urban design domain.<br /><br />I have used HoloLens as my visualization tools and studied the development on UWP with Unity for over one year. I am good at many languages such as C++, C#, Java,  as well as various computer technologies such as website design, database, etc.  I still have large enthusiasm to learn the new technologies. "

## Mission statement

Urban designing is about shaping the physical features of cities, towns and villages and planning for the provision of municipal services to residents and visitors. Rather than proposing a traditional on-site field research before the real designing with manual drawing and measurement on papers, modern designing can be easily tasked on a digital map from which multiple kinds of geophysical information can be retrieved quickly and accurately. However, designers are usually used to planning on a 2-dimentional (2D) displayed basemap (e.g. Esri ArcGIS Maps) which has limitation for only showing a top-down view of the planned area, while a more immersive experience could be provided if the map can be displayed in 3D. Based on this idea, this application was created for computer-aided urban designing in a more interactive way of using voice control and 3D immersive display.
