## Mission statement

As the world densifies and urban areas become a major hub for human social and economic growth, countries around the world are putting more emphases on urban sustainability. To achieve global sustainability and prosperity for all, The United Nations has developed 17 [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/), that aim to act as guidelines to achieve all goals by 2030\. Goal 11 directly deals with Sustainable Cities and Communities and provides a basic outline of the targets.

Recognizing the importance of sustainability, The City of Calgary has developed sustainability strategies and goals. The first being [The 2020 Sustainability Direction Report](http://www.calgary.ca/PDA/pd/Documents/municipal-development-plan/2020-sustainability-direction.pdf), which outlines the city’s sustainability tactics to make the city sustainable now without compromising future generations and their needs. The second is incorporated into Calgary’s [Municipal Development Plan](http://www.calgary.ca/PDA/pd/Pages/Municipal-Development-Plan/Goals-for-a-Well-Planned-Calgary.aspx) (MDP). The MDP outlines 6 city-wide policies for making Calgary a sustainable city: 1\. Prosperous economy, 2\. Shaping a more compact urban form, 3\. Creating great communities, 4\. Urban design, 5\. Connecting the city, 6\. Greening the city.

The city of Calgary is our home. Therefore, we decided to create an application for Calgarians which has the potential to empower citizens to make changes in their life and to help create more sustainable communities. The goal of this application is to bridge the gap between Calgary's city-wide policies and its citizen engagement. Since sustainability can be defined in different terms by different individuals, this application allows the user to define what sustainability means to them on their own terms and evaluate the communities in their city based on their definition. We believe that greening the city, connecting the city, and city compactness are areas that individuals can have the most impact on by making achievable changes in their lives. These aspects are the focus of this application.
