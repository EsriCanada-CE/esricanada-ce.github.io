## Mission statement

Public transportation is essential to the sustainability of any city. It increases the mobility and freedom of citizens by enhancing access to the city as a whole, allowing people to venture outside of their own communities. In addition to enabling transportation to the workplace and consumer hotspots, it connects people to public services, such as hospitals, libraries, parks, and museums. Not every Calgarian can afford to drive (Sustainable Calgary, 2019). Unequal access to transit can place cities at risk of isolating large portions of communities (Sustainable Calgary, 2019). This may be especially relevant for youth and seniors, who may be more likely to rely on public transportation.

The Open City application was created with three goals in mind:

1. To bring attention to communities that lack sufficient access to public services via public transportation.
   This will enable city planners and developers to address any lack of public transit accessibility amongst those communities.
2. To empower citizens to make better-informed decisions regarding housing choices.
3. To inspire people to use public transportation and to explore local public services, via a user friendly application.
