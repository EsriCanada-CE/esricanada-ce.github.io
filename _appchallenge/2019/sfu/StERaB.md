## Mission statement

Our app places aim and focus on accessibility to put emphasis on the importance in accommodating outdoor recreation
in sustainable communities. With the creation of this app, it is our goal to create an interactive software whereby
local residents, visitors and tourists can gain information about public washroom and park accessibility. Users will
be shown the most effective bike routes to navigate throughout Vancouver in order to reach their areas of interest,
and parks which fit their needs.

### Problem Addressed:

Current compact city strategies put additional pressure on green structure within the city (Koppen, Sang, & Tveit.2014).
Urban parks not only moderate the temperature in the city, they are sites for recreational purposes and provides safe routes
for different modes of transportation. It has been estimated that poor accessibility and lack of access to recreational
areas accounts for around 3.3% of global deaths (WHO). Many studies have also shown that recreational spaces such as green
space plays a pivotal role in population-level mental health (NCBI). Recent research has also further shown that the distance
or proximity to a recreational landscape affects how people perceive their own health (Van den Berg et al., 2010). Urban parks
have proven their value and importance as components of the urban infrastructure improving the quality of life. Urban parks
offer ecological and social services to the population (recreation, leisure, better population health state), increase the
economic, social and aesthetic value of urban ecosystems, offer the opportunity to reserve space for future town-plan projects
and assist in conserving local biological diversity. The size of urban parks represents an important indicator for assessing
the sustainability and competitiveness of urban ecosystems - their availability is an expression of the housing quality (Ioja et. al.2010).
As previously stated, this application aims to bring together the growing importance of environmental sustainability with link
to public accessibility as part of a sustainable urban system. Residents of lowincome communities are usually found to have lower
physical activity, and this may be due partly to a disparity in access to parks and other recreation environments
(Floyd, T & Whitt-Glover. 2009). This open data application is designed to be a contributing factor to reducing such disparities.
