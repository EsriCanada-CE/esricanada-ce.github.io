## Mission statement

To help the group of people who have an interest in non-market housing projects, we take safety, green transit and social interaction into considerations in order to find the most suitable housing projects within Vancouver area. The reason we are doing the project is to draw the public attentions on the group of people who are low-income yet still have rights to have wellbeing.
