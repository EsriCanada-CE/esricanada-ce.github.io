## Mission statement

Climate change is a serious issue facing Canadians. A key part of responding to climate change is creating political will to invest in sustainable infrastructure, and make regulatory changes that reduce carbon emissions. In Canada, over 40% of carbon emissions come from transportation-related sources. Therefore, this web app takes StatsCan commuter data to recommend what type of transportation the government should invest in to reduce carbon emissions from personal transportation. Users can then email their local Member of Parliament to demand transport action now.
