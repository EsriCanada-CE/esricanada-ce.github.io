## Mission statement

Sustainable communities are designed to be economically, socially, and environmentally connected while allowing for improvement and adaptation. Our app "Earthling" aims to connect people with sustainable initiatives, contribute new ideas, and organize opportunities. The application allows users to identify and report areas around London that promote sustainability.

Key focus areas:

Transportation

  - Biking or hiking

Food

  - Owned by locals, using local ingredients

  - Reduction of plastics

Shopping

  - Zero-waste shop, (eg. Bulk Barn bring-your-own jar)

Groups

  - Community gardens, community centres

  - Eg. Envirowestern, ReHarvest, Urban Roots London, Zero Waste Forest City
