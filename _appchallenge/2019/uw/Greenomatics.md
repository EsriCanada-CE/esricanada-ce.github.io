## Mission statement

Our vision for sustainable urban development is the reduction of single-household grocery trips through a grocery delivery service in Calgary. With our app, users will be able to see how a delivery service that accommodates multiple homes can further environmental sustainability through decreasing the emissions of single-household grocery trips.
