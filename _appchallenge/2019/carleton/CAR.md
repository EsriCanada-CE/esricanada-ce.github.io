    bio: "I am a fourth-year Geomatics major with dual minors in History and Classics. My focus is on applying GIS, geomatics, and remote sensing applications in archaeology, history, and heritage preservation. This work has only just begun for me, and my goal of preserving the past in the present for the future is what I continually strive to achieve."
  - name: "Cameron Fitzpatrick"
    bio: "I am a second-year BSc Geomatics major at Carleton. The parts of the program I enjoy most are the programming side of GIS, as well as remote-sensing. Participating in the app challenge this year has been an enjoyable opportunity to further my programming skills. In my spare time I enjoy photography, camping, cycling and programming!"
  - name: "Ryan Parker"
    bio: "I am working on my masters in geography with a specialization in data science under the supervision of Dr. Murray Richardson and Dr. Stephan Gruber. I completed my BSc in geomatics at Carleton in spring 2017 and decided to return as a grad student in fall 2018. My research will be looking the dynamics of retrogressive thaw slump approaching the Dempster Highway in the Northwest Territories using structure-from-motion photogrammetry and various other GIS techniques. In my free time Iâ€™m typically found skateboarding, snowboarding, rock climbing, or on some sort of adventure."

## Mission statement

We are currently in an age of transition. Technology and energy are both aspects of human life that we seek to attain, reproduce, and refine for the benefit of civilization. With the slow transition from fossil fuels to renewable energies, it is important for everyone to know and understand exactly how renewable energies benefit them.

With the growing availability and continued cost reductions of solar technology in particular, more and more people around the globe are investing in this technology for both the financial and environmental benefits. The rooftop of a building is a prime location to collect solar energy for the purpose of electricity generation. This electricity can be used to power buildings within our community more sustainably and has the added benefit of reducing electricity costs! Our mission with GoSolar is to give the people of Ottawa an estimate into the solar energy their roof receives to better inform them on the power-generating potential of their rooftop.
