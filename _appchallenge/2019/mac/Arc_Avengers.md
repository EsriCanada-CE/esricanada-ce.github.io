## Mission statement

Poor planning policy can make or break cities. Urban sprawl, vacant land, and resource deserts affect the wellbeing of communities and the health of our environment.

For the City of Hamilton, a number of strategies, planning frameworks, and initiatives have been put in practice to help plan our city more sustainably. The Neighbourhood Action Strategy (NAS) is just one of the many plans that aim to make Hamilton a great place to live, work, and raise a family. In order to realize this dream, the focus of the NAS is on community resources that foster positive, healthy and sustainable neighbourhoods.

This means that continued resident engagement is crucial, and our rePurpose app will facilitate that engagement. Residents will be able to explore community resources in their area with our accessible and easy-to-use WebApp. Based on their own expertise of their communityâ€™s needs, they will be able to suggest how and where the land in their neighbourhood can be better utilized via a GeoForm.

The submission data for this app will be publicly available, making it easy for urban planners, policymakers, and community leaders to have a better understanding of resident needs. Sustainable urban development begins with building sustainable communities, and residents are the experts of those communities.
