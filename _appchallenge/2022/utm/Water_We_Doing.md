    bio: "I am a fourth-year undergraduate student competing in this challenge for the first time. I am majoring in physical geography, with minors in biology and sociology. GIS and remote-sensing courses have been my favourites during my studies, so I am excited to learn more and develop my skills in this challenge! In my spare time, I dabble in graphic design, writing, and literature. I also spend hours poring over old and new maps, discovering what has been discovered before. I hope to one day contribute some of my own knowledge to future cartophiles."

## Mission statement
Our goal was to create a tool that showcases the risks of flooding to infrastructure projects in Canada. Flooding can cause loss of life, damage to property or infrastructure, and severe economic devastation if not properly mitigated. Despite the risks posed by flooding, many Canadian infrastructure projects are located within floodplain areas. Our mission is to highlight the proximity of upcoming infrastructure projects to existing and historical floodplains.

## App statement
Poseidon is designed to help companies, organizations, and individuals visualize the proximity of infrastructure projects to provincial floodplains. Projects approved by Infrastructure Canada are displayed over top of polygons representing both historical floodplains and recent flood extents. End users can view the details of the project and query whether or not it lies within a set proximity to areas historically prone to flooding. The app can be used as a demonstration of the importance of easily accessible digital mapping of flood plains.
