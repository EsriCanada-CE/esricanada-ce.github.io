### Mission Statement

Every year, approximately 8,000 wildfires occur across Canada, devastating communities and removing people from their homes. While wildfires affect everyone, they are particularly devastating towards Indigenous Communities. They are often not well connected to government resources and often face discrimination. Additionally, Indigenous communities tend to be of lower-income population, making them particularly vulnerable to natural hazards. Bringing attention to wildfire effects on Indigenous communities, will help alleviate this vulnerability through certified sources of funding and donations.

Safer Space will help users understand the impact of fires on Indigenous Territories across Canada, document potential hazardous material based on the type of spill and location on the map.
