## Mission Statement

In Canada, there has been an increase in losses caused by natural disasters from the past 25 years. The Insurance Bureau of Canada estimated the total insured losses in the event of natural disaster had reached 3 billion in 2016, while the loss was only around 50 million in 2000. Seven out of ten costliest disasters are recorded in Alberta. Wildfire is the one of the most common disasters in Canada. The costliest disaster, Fort McMurray wildfire in 2016, has an estimated loss of 3.82 billion.

MusCALar intends to provide general public with a general understanding of the locations of wildfire happened in Alberta. We also assess the proximity to wildfire from populated region. This helps local residents to be aware of the risk of experiencing wildfire in the future.
