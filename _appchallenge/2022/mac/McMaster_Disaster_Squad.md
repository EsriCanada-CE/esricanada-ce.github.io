## Mission Statement

Natural disaster prevalence has been on the rise in Canada in recent decades. From ice storms to wildfires or floods, disasters can disrupt lives, threaten safety, and cause tremendous anxiety. **They also can bring communities closer.** _Evacuation Canada_ is a one-stop hub designed for Canadians dealing with natural disasters. Our mission is threefold:

1. Help individuals navigate to safety, around various natural disasters and environmental hazards. We do this by combining the official sources Canadians know and trust, and by displaying crowd-sourced data from Canadians, for Canadians. These citizen-supported, open-source datasets help build resilient responses to natural disasters.
2. Respond to emergencies with unity and kindness is key to sustainable and resilient community-building. We connect those in need of emergency housing with those in their area that are able to provide shelter in hard times.
3. Provide easy access to important government resources, to inform those facing environmental hazards on government recommendations during the emergency.
