## Mission Statement

Ottawa has a history of being affected by flooding along Ottawa River, Rideau River, and adjacent small creeks and lakes. Most recent flood events in May 2016, July 2018, and the most severe one in April and May 2019 affected many streams, lakes, watersheds, and local neighbourhoods around the city of Ottawa (CBC News, 2017, 2018, 2019; Ottawa River Regulation Planning Board, 2019; Pringle, 2019). The floodplain is monitored by conservation authorities within the city of Ottawa including South Nation Conservation, Rideau Valley Conservation and Mississippi Valley Conservation providing historical flood plain maps and real-time monitoring information (City of Ottawa, 2021). While the temperature rises and snow continues to melt, the city of Ottawa has put out an Emergency Preparedness plan on their website in March for the upcoming 2022 spring flood to reduce potential socio-economical losses (City of Ottawa, 2022b). We identify that the existing resources and information are scattered and disconnected. To combine various resources and information related to flooding in Ottawa, the flood prevention information guide aims to deliver an intuitive navigation system that gathers geospatial information including the geography of the Ottawa water system and resources available in the city to aid citizens in better preparing for the upcoming flood season.
