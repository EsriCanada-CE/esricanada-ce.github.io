    bio: "Amir starts his Ph.D. program in January 2020 at the Geomatics Engineering Program, Lassonde School of Engineering, York University. He got his M.Sc. in the field of Geospatial Information System (GIS) Engineering from the University of Tehran. His passion is to bridge the gap between industry and academia in transportation systems design and development. His research domain includes geospatial data analytics, Location-Based Service(LBS) development, Quantum computing, and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Currently, he is working on geospatial problems that can be solved as a discrete model, and he tries to solve algorithms with high computational complexity on quantum annealing computers. He is always ready to face challenges with a problem-solving manner."

## Mission Statement

### Our Mission is to give everyone access to reliable and real-time information in the event of a major emergency.
During a major emergency, uncertainty and distress may lead to uninformed and dangerous decisions. People’s preparedness levels may also vary depending on the nature of the emergency.

Soteria is designed to work with emergency response units, law enforcement, and the government to provide real-time critical information to those in the affected area as well as to those who have family or friends there. This application also allows people in the area to add relevant information for the community. Crowdsourcing leverages the community to provide a direct impact while easing the burden of emergency response services.

The current war in Ukraine is an example of why creating this application is so important. One of our team is from Ukraine with many friends and family members there. Each person has expressed the lack of reliable information and the ability to share and receive information from others around them.
