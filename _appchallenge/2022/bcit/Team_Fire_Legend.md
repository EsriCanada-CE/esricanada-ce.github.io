  - name: "Sapphire Liu"
    bio: "Sapphire graduated from Dalhousie University with a Master of Resource and Environmental Management Degree in 2014. She also spent two years in North Carolina to complete a Bachelor of Environmental Science Degree. She became interested in GIS after printed out her first giant map of North Carolina in the Cartography class. She worked in Bedford Institute of Oceanography for six months and used her GIS skills to monitor green crabs (invasive species) in Nova Scotia. Currently, she is enrolled in the Advanced Diploma program in Geographic Information Systems at BCIT to gain more professional GIS skills. After completing this program, she looks forward to exploring the GIS industry. During her spare time, she likes crafting, baking and hiking."

## Mission Statement

As we head towards the future, it is inevitable that our society will face serious natural disaster emergencies. These disasters can range from earthquakes, floods, forest fires and tsunamis. Although we cannot prevent natural disasters from happening, we can mitigate the impacts through preparation and using the proper response steps.

Proper emergency preparation for disaster events is a life-or-death matter. Preparation creates greater opportunities to survive in disaster events but not all preparation methods are the same. Preparing for an earthquake is not the same as preparing for a flood and response plans used in tsunamis will differ then those used in wildfires. It is important to know different preparation methods and plans to be properly ready for all disaster situations.

The goal of the EmergenBC Hub is to create a hub that consolidates disaster response and preparation information for the public while also acting as a pseudo-rescue app to aid the efforts of first responders during disaster times. The EmergenBC Hub directs users and viewers to available resources listed by the British Columbia provincial government and showcases disaster efforts and resources created by their local municipal government as well. In addition, the app provides an emergency response form for users to indicate their status after a natural disaster has happened and their status is then updated to a live map to help aid rescue efforts or to inform family and friends.
