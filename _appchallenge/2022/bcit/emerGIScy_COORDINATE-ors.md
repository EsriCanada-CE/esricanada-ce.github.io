  - name: "Ben Schager"
    bio: "Ben is a student in the Advanced Diploma program at BCIT. As a former neuroscientist who didn't have the brains for science, GIS provided an avenue for Ben to pursue a lingering interest in generating, analyzing, and presenting data while working in an industry where one doesn’t often need to go the lab at 2 in the morning. Ben graduated with a BASC from Quest University Canada and a MSc from the University of Victoria, both studying neuroscience. Naturally, given his educational background, Ben has worked extensively in forestry. It was there that he discovered and fell in love with GIS and the problems that it was created to solve. If you want to see Ben when he isn’t tinkering with some script, studying, or reading a book, you will have to ask him to go for a bike ride. Fair warning: He will probably try to persuade you to go for a beer afterward!"

  - name: "Matt Meeboer"
    bio: "Matt is a current BCIT GIS Advanced Diploma student. After completing a diploma in Computer Systems Technology from the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology, he worked in several industries as a business systems analyst where he was exposed to GIS and gained an appreciation for the many problems it can solve. In 2021, Matt decided to pivot his career into GIS, and has been focused on spatial analysis and GIS-focused application development, specifically for urban use cases. In his free time, he enjoys biking, playing music with friends, and strategy games."

## Mission Statement

The mission of the Disaster Response applications is for government organizations to provide real-time information on disasters and emergencies, as well as potential hazards, to citizens. Disaster Response is designed for citizens to receive mobile notifications based on their proximity to events so they can adequately prepare, as well as browse potential threats in their area. A design philosophy emphasizing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate UI was embraced during design and development. Our application currently covers only Metro Vancouver due to resource and time constraints of the app challenge, but expanding our coverage to all of Canada would be the logical next step.

The Disaster Response applications align with the theme of this year's ESRI Canada Centers of Excellence (ECCE) App Challenge – Natural Disasters and Emergency Preparedness, alongside the sub-themes of Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure.
