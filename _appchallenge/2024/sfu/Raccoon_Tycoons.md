## Mission Statement

Our mission is to equip users with a fundamental comprehension of urbanization while offering visual representation of its proliferation in Canada, with a focus on the Southern Ontario region, specifically the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area (CMA). We aim to illustrate the impact of uncontrolled urban growth, particularly on the environment, through clear descriptions and visual aids. Furthermore, we seek to highlight the threat urbanization poses to natural areas within the CMA, such as Ontarioâ€™s Greenbelt. In addition to raising awareness, we strive to provide valuable insights into potential solutions to mitigate the adverse effects of urbanization, fostering informed decision-making and sustainable practices for the future.
