## Mission Statement

Canada is becoming increasingly urbanized. With most Canadians living in urban centers, and new arrivals to the country flocking to cities, understanding how cityscapes have evolved to support such growth is crucial. 
Halifax is currently one of Canadaâ€™s fastest growing urban centers, which allows for its urban expansion to be examined as it is emblematic of larger changes seen across Canada (Statistics Canada, 2022). Over the past three centuries Halifax has experienced massive transformation from its birth as a colonial military outpost, and emerging over periods of industrialization and suburbanization into the city as we know it today. Our mission is to showcase urban expansion through the lens of urban historical geography, where Halifax can be used as a case study to highlight the processes that have transformed Canadian cities. In doing so we will explore the colonial, industrial, and modern evolutions of the city, and gain a deeper understanding of the issues surrounding urban expansion that planners face as they design cities of the present and future.
