    bio: "I am a student in the GIS Graduate Certificate program at COGS. After a career in the software industry, I decided to pursue a long-held but unexplored interest in geography and GIS and enrolled in the online program at COGS. I am loving learning about GIS technologies and their seemingly endless applications to real-world challenges. When I'm not wrangling map you can find me baking, making quilts and hanging out with my family."
  - name: "Amy Hazlett"
    bio: "Amy Hazlett is currently enrolled remotely in the Geographic Information Systems Graduate Certificate program at the Centre of Geographic Sciences. Amy has a Bachelor of Arts in History, with passion in archaeology and ancient history. After stumbling upon GIS in early 2022, she decided to make a leap and take a chance on a totally new career path. With a hard few months behind her, she is hopping that this challenge will be a good chance to showcase for her newly learned skills!"

## Mission Statement

As cities expand and prices increase, people are looking for ways to cut down on costs while still contributing to their local communities and thus urban agriculture is becoming more popular. Providing spaces and opportunities for citizens to practice urban gardening regardless of their living situation helps to makes cities more livable and community-oriented. 

Our app, Community Garden Site Finder, aims to help citizens search for suitable locations for potential new community gardens around the Edmonton, Alberta area. The app also provides information and some references that can be used to help get a garden started.
