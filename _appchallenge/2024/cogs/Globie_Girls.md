    bio: "I am currently in the postgraduate program in GIS at COGS,  where my academic interests are in data visualization, statistics, ecology, and conservation. I was introduced to GIS during my undergraduate degree in marine biology at Dalhousie University. Ever since, I have been fascinated by all of its applications and uses and have been eager to learn more. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, sewing, and drawing. I am so excited to participate in the app challenge with my team, learn some new skills, and have fun along the way!"

    bio: "I am currently a student in the Geographic Information Systems program at the NSCC Centre Of Geographic Sciences (NSCC). I graduated with a bachelors of science in Environment and Natural Resources from the University of New Brunswick in 2021. I enjoyed applying GIS to environment related challenges, and using map creation to connect people with the natural world, both in my undergraduate degree and in my time working for the Nature Trust of New Brunswick, an NGO involved in land protection. I am inspired by the ways in which GIS technology can improve human and environmental health, and support community building. These applications of GIS, and the enjoyment I get from data communication, is what caused me to want to gain a deeper understanding of GIS technology, and what led me to enroll in my current graduate program at COGS. In my free time I enjoy exploring the outdoors, learning new plant species, and crafting! "

    bio: "I am currently enrolled in the Geographic Information Systems graduate program at COGS. I have an undergraduate degree from Mount Allison University in Environmental Science, Physics and GIS. For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated with maps and as a student found I enjoy working with different kinds of data, so GIS is the best of both worlds. In my free time, I enjoy swimming, hiking, baking, and knitting. I am excited to challenge myself and apply my skills to the App Challenge!  "

## Mission Statement

There is a negative relationship between food security and urbanization. As people migrate to cities, and the city footprints grow, there are fewer farmers, and less land to put farms on (Kang et al., 2023). The City of Halifax states that the average distance that food travels to get to Nova Scotia is 4,000km (Halifax, 2024). In a post 2020 world, we are very aware of the dangers of relying on remote food supply chains. In addition, as of 2022, 1 in 4 people in Halifax were food insecure (Feed Nova Scotia, 2023). This increase in food insecurity is not unique to this one city. Canada wide, the number of people who don’t have enough food day to day is growing (Statistics Canada, 2023). As grocery prices continue to rise, there is no sign of relief to come.  

BoroughGreen, which is based in the city of Halifax and part of the Halifax Regional Municipality, aims to help users determine how suitable their land is for growing food, and to give recommendations on what type of garden to set up and what to grow. It also gives locations of community gardens and fruit trees located across the city. Through this app, we want to show that there are still ways to garden in a city, even if you don’t have the space or proper soil. Our goal for BouroughGreen is to help address food insecurity in Halifax by connecting people with local food resources and empowering them to grow food in their own backyards, on their porches, and in community gardens.
