    bio: "I'm currently pursuing my Master of Engineering degree at the Department of Geodesy and Geomatics Engineering at the University of New Brunswick. This semester marks the culmination of my academic journey. Alongside my studies, I've been engaged as a part-time Geomatics Analyst, contributing to the development of a Historical Database covering the principal cities of New Brunswick: Fredericton, Saint John, and Moncton. Additionally, I've been actively involved in the Esri Canada Centre of Excellence Student Associate program for the past two years. Beyond academics and professional endeavors, I have a keen interest in travel, literature, music, sports, as well as technology and its innovative applications."

## Mission Statement

Our objective is to deliver a revolutionary tool that highlights the state of urban areas under the flood levels impacted by climate change. By seamlessly integrating 3D building structures, we offer an immersive experience that enhances our understanding of the associated damages to the urban areas. Our goal is to equip communities, urban planners, and decision-makers with invaluable insights to effectively address the complexities of urban expansion while proactively mitigating the risks associated with climate change induced flooding.
