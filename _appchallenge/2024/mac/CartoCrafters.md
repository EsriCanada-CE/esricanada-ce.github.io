  - name: "Alex Furukawa"
    bio: "I am a fourth year Ph.D of Earth and Environmental Sciences in the Mac Ecohydrology Lab and an ECCE student associate. My research explores the hydrological dynamics of the peatlands of the Boreal Shield and how that influences their resilience to climate change and wildfire. I’ve been a long-time teaching assistant for GIS at McMaster since my M.Sc and integrate it into my field-based research wherever I can. When I’m not in the outdoors for science reasons I also love hiking and fishing, though not typically in peatlands."

  - name: "Farah Chin"
    bio: "I’m in my final year of the Honours Mathematics and Biology program, and pursuing a certificate in GIS. I’m particularly interested in the application of GIS techniques and spatial statistics to topics in epidemiology and public health. I’m currently working as an assistant in the Lloyd Reeds Map Collection, where I'm working on a project exploring the development of 19th century polar maps in conjunction with scientific expeditions. In my spare time I’m usually crocheting, playing Zelda, or watching horror movies."

  - name: "Leah Smith"
    bio: "I am a fourth-year Honours Integrated Science student (Conc. Earth & Environmental Science) and an ECCE student associate. I am currently pursuing a concurrent certificate in GIS, as well as PGO certification. I am currently working on my undergraduate thesis, evaluating badland susceptibility in Basilicata, Italy, through a regression-based MCE approach. Outside of academia, I can be found listening to my latest Spotify Daylist, playing my ukulele, sending my friends Reels, or rehearsing for the MacSci Musical."

## Mission Statement

Our mission is to provide a comprehensive and interactive guide to Hamilton’s over 5700 hectares of parks and green space, which are under pressure from a rising demand for usage and land from a rapid urbanization and population growth. On top of being a handy tool for finding parks that meet one’s needs, we aim to build a picture of where there are green space ‘deserts’ in terms of coverage and accessibility. We aim to make this picture clearer as the user is empowered to contribute to a growing database so that information better reflects the state of green spaces at the ground level.
