    bio: "I am currently enrolled in McMaster Universityâ€™s Honours of Environmental Science program and am working toward my concurrent certificate in GIS. After I graduate in April, I plan to pursue my education in GIS at NSCC - COGS in September. Currently, I am using ArcGIS Pro and the arcbinding() package in R for my independent study research. This research involves building an R-Script tool to perform a geospatial analysis of impaired and distracted driving in Toronto, Ontario. Outside of academics, I enjoy running, hanging out with my dog and attending any and all concerts. "

## Mission Statement

The 2021 census showed that Toronto, Ontario has a population of 2.7 million, occupying 7.6% of total Canadian population (City of Toronto, 2022). By 2030, the population is forecasted to increase to 3.5 million people by 2030 (Muller, 2023). With an expanding population comes an expanding city with more buildings, roads and infrastructure.  With the expansion of the city, comes more difficulties for individuals to be sustainable and connect with the outdoors. This app aims to aid the population, and visitors of Toronto, to overcome this issue. Through the use of different app pages users may explore ways to explore the outdoors, and also help in sustainable practices.
