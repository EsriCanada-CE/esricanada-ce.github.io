## Mission Statement

In 2021, nearly three in four Canadians lived in one of the country's large urban centres. As cities continue to densify, what effects will residents see on the social fabric of their communities?

Team Fler's app **MetroPulse BC** describes this trend at the national level, then gives users the ability to quickly explore key metrics related to densification impacts on British Columbia's urban centres (census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations, as defined by Census Canada).

With **MetroPulse BC**, decision makers can view key trends, opportunities, and challenges in provincial-level resources, framed specifically within the context of recent urban densification percentage change (both positive and negative). As a form of data journalism, the general public can also use the app to build greater understanding about urban trends and which areas are being most impacted. Lastly, a geospatially-informed survey invites users to share their experiences about how urban densification has impacted their lives, which Team Fler envisions as a data-collection prototype for community engagement projects.
