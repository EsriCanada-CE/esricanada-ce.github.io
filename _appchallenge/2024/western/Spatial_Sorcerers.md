## Mission Statement

Our team is dedicated to the creation of innovative solutions that utilize Esri technology to address pressing urban and environmental challenges. Through our app, our aim is to provide good insight into a couple things between a 2010 to 2020 time range in British Columbia; The changing human footprint index (HFI), especially around urban centers, and wildfires that are increasing over the years that pose a risk to urban centers. By visualizing urban growth and wildfires, our app aims to empower users with information to make informed decisions regarding urban development, land use planning, and wildfire risk mitigation strategies.
