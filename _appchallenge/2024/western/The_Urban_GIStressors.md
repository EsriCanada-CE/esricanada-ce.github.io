## Mission Statement

Our team, the Urban GIStressors, aimed to create an app that provides information on the population density of London, Ontario in an accessible format. London is a growing city, impacted by ongoing urbanization. As such, the population has seen drastic changes between 2016 and 2021. We wanted to create a visual for this change, so that individuals such as urban planners, developers, and those looking to move to the city, can note areas of significant shift and growth in population. While looking at population density numbers alone can show obvious increases but a visual, such as our map app, is essential to spatial understanding of the city’s growth both as a whole and by neighborhood!
