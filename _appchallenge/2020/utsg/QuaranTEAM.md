    bio: "Cathy is a 3rd year undergraduate student at U of T studying Physiology, Human Geography and GIS. She was the lead researcher and data curator for this project. Her interests lie in public health and assessing psychosocial barriers to healthcare access. Throughout this experience, she thoroughly enjoyed being able to merge her background and knowledge in healthcare and clinical research with the tools she has learned from her GIS courses. She hopes in the future to be able to continue using geospatial technologies to help communicate and solve health problems. In her free time, she enjoys listening to podcasts, playing piano, and watching her favourite sports teams."

## Mission statement

The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11th, 2020<sup>1</sup>, and now surpasses 500,000 cases across 200 countries<sup>2</sup>. While the events of this outbreak are still unfolding, this unprecedented event has already devastated many communities, resulting in loss of life, depletion of healthcare resources, and economic instability.
 
The ability of a community to prevent and minimize harm and financial loss in the face of disaster is typically linked to its social conditions. Vulnerable communities with poorer social indicators are often less prepared for disaster, and less likely to fully recover<sup>3</sup>. Effectively identifying and addressing these disparities is crucial to address health inequities and ensure community resilience to new health risks.
 
Vulnerability indices summarize social and spatially relevant information, and are often used by public health officials, planners, and policymakers to respond to emergency events, such as natural disasters, anthropogenic events, or disease outbreak. The Centers for Disease Control’s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) compiles dimensions such as socioeconomic status and household composition to help identify vulnerable communities that need support before, during, and after a hazardous event<sup>3</sup>. Locally, Public Health Ontario’s Ontario Marginalization Index (ON-Marg) also measures multiple indicators of deprivation, based on dimensions of residential instability, dependency, and ethnic concentration<sup>4</sup>.
 
While these indices provide substantial value towards identifying vulnerable populations, in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, social vulnerability indicators alone may not paint the whole picture. We are observing early on that COVID-19 disproportionately affects the senior population<sup>5</sup>, and as a communicable disease, is more likely to affect densely populated areas. As such, our goal was to develop a COVID-19-specific index, to identify susceptible populations and evaluate the vulnerability of Toronto neighbourhoods in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.
