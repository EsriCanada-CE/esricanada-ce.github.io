## Mission statement

The goal of **Data Empire** is to advise people of the potential spread of COVID-19 in
Canada. Applying our model to our web app can show individuals the projections of this
pandemic. Our goal is for people to visually see the numbers of the growing spread and
rethink their actions and to stay at home. We hope that individuals view our map and
become aware of taking strong personal measures and staying at home can help
decrease these numbers.
