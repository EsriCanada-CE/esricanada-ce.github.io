## Mission statement

Welcome to Anti-allergies, this is a user-interactive web app developed for the Canadian population that is sensitive to seasonal allergy. According to the research, approximately 20% to 25% percent of Canadians suffer from this seasonal allergy, which comes from certain species of trees that release pollen during springtime. Under this circumstance, the patients are unable to do outdoor activities such as hiking and short distance city trips, due to severe symptoms of sneezing, itchy eyes, hives and coughing. Thus, the purpose of this web app is to assist the allergy-sensitive population to locate the areas in the city where there are various trees that release allergens, in order to avoid the illness and make well-prepared city trips.
