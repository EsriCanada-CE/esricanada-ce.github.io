    bio: "I am a 4th year undergraduate student in Honours Earth and Environmental Science pursuing a minor in GIS. I am interested in GIS applications to improve the social and environmental challenges we face, resulting from the coexistence of biodiversity, industry, and human population. The app challenge is an exciting opportunity to collaborate with my peers on current issues, as I am seeking challenges to apply my skills learned in the classroom. Additional hobbies include film photography, playing guitar, and hiking."

    bio: "I am a 2nd year undergraduate student in Honours Geography and Environmental Science pursuing a minor in GIS. I am currently enrolled in an advanced raster and remote sensing course and I plan on taking many more similar courses in the future. I am interested in pursuing a career specializing in GIS. My interest in this field was first sparked by multiple presentations done by Pat DeLuca in first year. I enjoy sports and online games in my free time. Being only in second year, I think this challenge is the perfect chance for me to work with peers above me and gain experience that will help me succeed in both my future classes as well as the workplace."

    bio: "I am a 4th year undergraduate student in the Honours Life Science program pursuing a minor in GIS. Throughout my studies, I have taken a variety of courses including Environmental Change & Human Health and Global Human Health & Disease which I hope to apply to this challenge. In the future, I would like to become a biomedical illustrator as I am interested in the visualization of science and data. Outside of class, I enjoy watercolour painting, sketching wildlife and playing video games."

## Mission statement

Since its initial appearance in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been formally declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen). This declaration calls for a coordinated international response and immediate action across the globe.

In these unprecedented times, adjustments to health care and resource allocation need to be made efficiently and effectively. As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise, government officials, community leaders, developers, etc. are forced to make decisions that impact the lives of countless people as well as the progression of the pandemic.

On March 23rd, Mayor John Tory announced a municipal emergency for the city of Toronto which stresses the need for even more drastic measures to prevent this disease from spreading further. According to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html), the outcome of contracting the virus can be more severe for older people and those with pre-existing health conditions such as asthma or auto-immune disorders. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to consider at-risk populations during this time.

Our app, **Toronto COVID-19 Susceptibility Assessment (TCSA)**, utilizes relevant economic, demographic and health data in order to evaluate which areas of the city are more susceptible to the spread of COVID-19. By using **TCSA**, one can identify neighbourhoods in Toronto that are in greater need of specific health services as well as those at greater risk to succumb to the virus by looking at layers of data weighted by importance. Ultimately, it is our hope that **TCSA** will provide the means for community leaders, government officials, developers and any decision-makers to make well-informed decisions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Examples include decisions regarding resource allocation within the city, possible drive-thru testing locations, new COVID-19 assessment centres, etc.
