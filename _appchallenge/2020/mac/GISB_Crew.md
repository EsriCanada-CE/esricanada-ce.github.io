## Mission statement

### The goals of CACL were very simple:

To help people find the nearest COVID-19 assessment center to them in the Greater Toronto/Hamilton Area. Then, display directions and information on how to access it. 

The final app is very simple, easy to use, and tells people the hours and specific information on which entrance to use and if a referral is needed. It's useful and has a few interesting features that make it very easy to be maintained.

Finally, users can print their directions to their nearest assessment center.

It's made through Esri's ArcGIS Online Web App Builder and currently found
