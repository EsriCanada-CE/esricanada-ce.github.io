## Mission statement

While the physical and mental health benefits of outdoor activity are well known, so are the potential hazards to people enjoying these activities. Three common concerns for hikers are insect stings, poison ivy, and bear encounters. AllergeNS is a tool to bring awareness to the potential hazards and accessibility to emergency services when out and about in Nova Scotia by integrating citizen scientist observations and hospital information.
