## Mission statement

Influenza, also known as flu, is a contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus that can be transmitted from person to person [1].  According to a recent survey, Flu had caused about 12,200 hospitalizations and 3,500 deaths in Canada each year [2] and the highest cumulative hospitalization rates are among the following:

- Children under age of 5
- Pregnant women
- People with chronic medical conditions and
- Adults 65 years of age and older.

The Alberta government has long been prepared to fight against the flu in recent decades. The Provincial government has $12.5 million is spent on purchasing 1.6 million doses of influenza vaccine for the 2019-2020 season, which is able to immunize 35% of the population in Alberta [2].

The purpose of our application is to provide a platform that raises citizens&#39; concerns about public health. Our application not only informs its citizens of the latest statistical news about the influenza but also provides an option to report about the same with related agencies/Government. The web application is developed with flu data in Alberta. However, other diseases or pandemics such as coronavirus can also be considered in the application.
