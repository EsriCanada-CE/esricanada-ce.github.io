## Mission statement

At *Routing4Safety*, we believe that everybody deserves to come home. We enable users to:

1) generate custom routes that avoid areas with high risk for road collisions,

2) engage with local traffic collision data to promote public awareness and prevent collisions, and

3) report collisions to support an up-to-date, crowdsourced dataset that promises to keep our service reliable.

As per the third Sustainable Development Goal focusing on good health and well-being, Routing4Safety is a data-driven, evidence-based solution that aligns with the United Nations’ commitment to halve the number of deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents.
