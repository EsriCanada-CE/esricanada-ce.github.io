## Mission statement

The environmental and health benefits of active transportation should be accessible to all members of the public, regardless of individual accessibility requirements. Accessible Active London (AAL) aims to evaluate and communicate the accessibility of walking/cycling paths around the city of London, Ontario. This mapping app promotes public engagement in heath, transport and accessibility through public participatory GIS (PPGIS), by inviting the public to use the app to plan active transportation and report accessibility issues in London. Public engagement in improving the accessibility of active transportation routes will make London a healthier, safer and more inclusive city while connecting members of the public.
