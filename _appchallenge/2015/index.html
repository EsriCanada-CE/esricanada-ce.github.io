  The winner of the challenge in 2015 is the team UW TeamSDS, from the University of Waterloo.  They build an app called PredictION, which aims to allow "governments to engage citizens in visualizing new transit routes, allowing citizens to analyze the routes' impact on travel times and service areas, and to compare new routes with the existing system" for the Grand Rivers Transit network in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo.
