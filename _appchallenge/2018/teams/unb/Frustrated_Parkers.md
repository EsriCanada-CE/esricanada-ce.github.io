## Mission Statement:

Have you ever been frustrated finding a parking spot when you are in a rush, or new to a city? We
aimed to create a mobile application to tackle the issues of finding parking spots and some of the other
issues that comes along with it.

Frustrated Parkers seeks to help users to find parking spots for their vehicles, be that a car, a bike,
or even an electric car. Knowing if a street has a restriction or if it will be a no parking zone is helpful in
planning where to park. More people are taking the environment into consideration by choosing to
carpool, own electric cars, or bike to work. There are designated spaces for these kind of vehicles, and
knowing where to park in these situations can help people to get a better parking spot. The app
functionality aims to ease the access to parking spots for visitors and residents in Toronto, and to provide
seamless and enjoyable experiences for parkers.
