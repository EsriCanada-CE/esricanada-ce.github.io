## Mission Statement:

CycleVan is an designed for people to use when planning a bike outing in Vancouver. We have compiled all the things around Vancouver that would be useful to a city-goer (and that have available information on Vancouver Open Data) into one easy to use application using ArcGIS Pro and Web AppBuilder (WAB).

This app is designed to promote a healthy outdoor lifestyle to it’s users while also providing them with all of the necessary information and direction to contribute to their local and municipal businesses (via the community markets information), decrease their environmental footprint (by providing information on the cities available ‘greener’ modes of transport such as cycling racks & paths and public transport), and to experience the extensive culture and history of Vancouver (by providing the locations and details of the vast number of art installations across the city).
