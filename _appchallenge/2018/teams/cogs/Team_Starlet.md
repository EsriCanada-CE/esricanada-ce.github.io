## Mission Statement:

To provide users with the optimal stargazing experience while fostering community science.

The intention of this application was to provide amateur and professional stargazers with the ability to find areas that are ideal for stargazing. Following along the veins of community science, we envisioned an application that was self-sufficient and created publicly open data.
