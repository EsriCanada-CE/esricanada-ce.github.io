## Mission Statement:

High volumes of traffic in the National and Provincial Parks across Canada has had a positive impact on Canadian tourism. After last years celebrations of Canada 150th birthday, where all the public was granted free access to the National Parks across the country, one must ask themselves how these increased numbers have affected the park. With large areas to maintain and an ever decreasing budget, it has become increasingly more difficult to properly monitor and protect Canada’s natural areas. High costs and unrealistic manhours would be associated with obtaining all the necessary information about the trails and recreation areas within the Parks.  

Why not use the increasing numbers of the public to aid in collection of real time data through trail, wildlife and facility reports? Introducing TrailCrew, a native mobile and web application that brings together outdoor enthusiasts together with parks staff to help report and maintain the natural world. The goal of this application is to crowdsource the collection of trail information, to allow for better delegation of resources and up to date information on trails and park facilities in the area.
