## Mission Statement:

Moving countries isn’t easy. Between finding the immigration office to get necessary documentation, the registry agency to get a health card, the motor association to get your license registered, and then finding the nearest IKEA to get furniture, the arrival process can be stressful, confusing, and complicated.

There are many programs and support services available to help new immigrants get settled, but the data existed in many siloed databases. Different databases can be accessed through Federal and Provincial agencies, NGOs and charities, and community associations, but can get lost in a sea of information, and isn’t always conducive to someone with beginner English language skills.

The Day One application is designed to easily locate areas of interest that any new immigrant or international student may need when they first arrive in Canada. Our idea was sparked from the experience one of our team members, who is an international student studying in Canada. When he first arrived, the process of getting settled was accompanied by many logistical hurdles, and he felt he could have benefited from having a single, easy-to-use resource where he could look for everything he needed.

We developed this application to help people in similar situations to optimize their “Day One” in Canada.
