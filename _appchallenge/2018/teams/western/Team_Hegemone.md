## Mission Statement

The 100‐mile diet is a movement growing in popularity with food enthusiasts. It is where people fill their
food basket with only locally grown produce eating only seasonally appropriate and regional foods.
Ideally, the practitioner of the diet only eats food that is grown or produced within a 100‐mile radius of
one’s home. This requires the individual to develop a greater awareness of from where each meal
comes. The major impediment to a successful 100‐mile diet is the factor of convenience.

At present, Huron County is home to a diversity of Local Farmers Markets that are enjoyed by visitors
and locals. These local markets are only open at set times, usually on weekend mornings, but not all the
produce that sold there is locally harvested. For those people trying to fill their food basket with locally
grown produce, the local food market might not be the most convenient choice.

Included in the food landscape are individual farmer’s fruit, and vegetable stands along the road‐way at
their farm’s gate. These farm gate markets are usually an informal way for local farm families to share
some of their extra produce directly with the public. Often these farm gate fruit and vegetable stands
are informal, unmanned and work on the honour system meaning that the produce is paid for by the
customer in a secure lock‐box. This provides a customer with some guarantee that the produce is grown
locally and the satisfaction of purchasing their food directly from those who grow it. For the farmer, this
means that they can sell their produce efficiently to their customers with little overhead and reduce the
need to transport their produce to their customers. For those people trying to fill their food basket with
locally grown produce and those interested in trying to live the 100 mile diet, the option of road‐side
farm gate food purchases is appealing. At present, the two main impediments to farm gate food
purchases are the distance to drive to the road‐side farm gate and the infrequency of available produce
for sale due to the informal nature of how road‐side farm gate stands are managed.

The Fresh.App responds directly to the second impediment whereby, the farmer can inform their
customers of the variety and availability of produce for sale in real time with live updates.

It will show buyers where, what, and when fresh food is available directly from the farmers!
