- name: "Jayden Choi"
  bio: "(left) I am currently enrolled in 4th year Earth and Environmental Sciences with a minor in GIS at McMaster University. With in-class knowledge and hands-on field experience in GIS, I took the opportunity to work on my thesis on “the impact of population on bike share hub usage”, under the supervision of Dr. Darren Scott. I found my interest in GIS & Spatial Analysis this past summer as I was assisting graduate students on SNAP, Stélida Naxos Archaeological Project, as a GIS/surveying intern. Upon completing my undergraduate studies, I plan to pursue a Master’s Degree in GIS, combined with social and natural sciences."

  bio: "(middle-left) I'm a 5th year student in the Honours Earth and Environmental Science program at McMaster University, minoring in GIS. My main research interests at the moment are integrating traditional earth science work such as hydrogeology, geophysics, and geomorphology with GIS as I enjoy working in both fields and believe each can add value to the other. I will be starting my M.Sc at McMaster in the fall, which involves integrating hydrology and remotely sensed data such as Lidar and hyperspectral imagery."

## Mission Statement:

Life in Canada’s largest city is rarely easy, with one in five Toronto residents currently living in poverty. For those struggling to make ends meet, it can be difficult to secure all necessities of western life such as sufficient nutrition, educational resources, and shelter on a daily basis. Currently, many government and private services exist in Toronto that aim to assist low-income residents in one or more areas. The issue is that all too often those in need do not realize these services exist, let alone where to access them until their situation becomes dire.

The goal of **Helping Hands Toronto** is to create an easy-to-use tool that consolidates community resources for at-risk or lower-income families in Toronto, based on open geospatial data hosted by the city. These resources include public libraries, licensed child-care services, youth services, supportive housing locations, and more. This app is a convenient interface for displaying the various available services and their locations, identifying and filtering amenities within a given radius of a user-defined location as well as provide directions from a location to a desired facility. Users may also locate services via a search function according to a number of attributes including name, street address, and service type.
