## Mission Statement

The mission of this app is to provide an enhanced site experience for the First Nations monuments in Oak Bay, BC that highlights the continued role of First Nations in the landscape. The goal of the Oak Bay monuments initiative is outlined by founder Marion Cumming: to start a conversation about the people and places that lived on the land for thousands of years. When walking around the manicured streets of Oak Bay it is hard to imagine the garry oak, red cedar, and Douglas fir ecosystems that supported thousands of Lâ€™kwungen speaking peoples. This app in key to addressing the increasingly the dynamic relationship between memory and place that is being challenged in the search modern individual and group identities.
