## Mission Statement

Ever had a tail light out? How did you find out that it was no longer working? We’re guessing that someone told you. That’s the idea behind this app – we let people know what isn’t working. Our idea is for the community to assist each other when things aren’t functioning properly. To start, we are focusing on traffic, mainly: road lights, stop signs and yield signs. If any of these things are malfunctioning, broken, or missing, our app will bring that to the attention of the required personnel who must tend to the issue. Our app creates a more accessible avenue for members of the community to notify each other, and their municipality leaders and road-side technicians of relevant issues.
