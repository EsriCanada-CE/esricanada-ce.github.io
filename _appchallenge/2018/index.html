  The App Challenge for 2018 is currently in-progress at ECCEs across Canada.
  <br /><br />
  
  After the challenge has completed at all ECCEs (by the end of March), you will find details about the participating teams presented here, along with their video presentations, and live app demonstrations.
  <br /><br />
  
  Check here in early April to see the creations of these teams.
