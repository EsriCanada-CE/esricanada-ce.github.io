    bio: "I am a fourth year Bachelor of Arts & Science student at McMaster and have significant interests in Urban Planning, as well as Travel Behaviour and Transportation Geography. My undergraduate thesis has been exploring downtown revitalization in my hometown to combat urban sprawl development on the city’s periphery. I am nearing completion of my GIS Certificate through the School of Earth, Environment and Society at Mac and am excited to use all of the skills learned in courses from desktop and online applications of ArcGIS, in my first App Challenge experience!"

    bio: "I am a 5th year undergraduate student in the Honours Environmental Science Co-op program while also pursuing a certificate in GIS. I have a huge interest in GIS and its applications in environmental modelling and sustainable future developments. The App Challenges provides an opportunity to challenge myself and apply all the skills I’ve learned throughout the years. I am also looking for a way to distinguish myself from others and the App Challenge is the perfect way to do that! Additionally, I enjoy playing sports and spending time outside."

## Mission statement

Income inequality is a serious issue around the world, and Canada is not immune to it.
One of the first steps to dealing with a problem is visualizing the effects of that problem. I-Cubed is a way of exploring a small portion of this issue in Hamilton.
