## Mission statement

Indicated by the UN, Sustainable Development Goals Target 10.1 is to “progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the national average by 2030” [1], in another word, to reduce income inequality and share prosperity. However, Canadians are facing challenges since the outbreak of COVID-19. Uneven recovery is amplifying economic disparities that existed pre-pandemic and widening the income gap, as working-class Canadians going deeper into debt while some remaining at the top prosper. Therefore, reducing income inequality is one of the top priorities for Canada in 2021.

Community and social services that support people to recover from hardship are essential at this moment. However, within Toronto - the largest and most populated city of Canada, some offices or programs are closed or impacted, and visits to residential programs are restricted to help protect residents and staff from the pandemic [2]. In order to help adjust strategies and allocate resource effectively, we would like to build an app reflecting which communities may have more people dealing with job losses, debt, eviction and food insecurity, and helping people to locate the nearest available programs and services.
