## Background

According to Statistics Canada, 22% of Canadians had at least one disability. And 10% of them have minor mobility issues. It brings an unfair inconvenience for them. In particular, not every building or public transit stations are accessible for people with mobile disability. But it is almost impossible to know whether if it is accessible before reaching the building. Therefore, this brings difficulties and inequality to people with disabilities exploring the urban area with transportation.


## 	Mission Statement

Our app focuses on creating convenient experiences for people with disabilities. The goal of our map is to reduce the gap between disability and ordinary people. Moreover, we want to support them having an equal chance to explore and experience urban life. Users can find the nearest accessible facilities and services available near them. Such as recreation facilities, disability support services, or disability parking spaces with our map application. Users can also search whether a subway station has accessible services.
