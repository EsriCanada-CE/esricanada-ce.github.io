## Mission Statement

There are many ways to reduce inequality. While there has been some positive change, studies show that inequality is growing for 70% of the global population (United Nations, 2020). This can make social and economic development difficult. Since the beginning of the pandemic, it has become obvious that Covid-19 is hitting vulnerable populations the hardest as well increasing discrimination for those same populations (United Nations, 2020). Target 10.7 of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to “facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies” (United Nations, 2020). This is because migration has been shown to contribute positively to development outcomes and some studies suggest that migration could be one of the best ways to significantly reduce global income inequality (Iqbal, 2015). Migrants and their families can benefit from many aspects of movement such as increased income, skills, and capacities (Crawley, 2018).

Overall migration has been shown to have a positive effect on the receiving country (Devarajan, 2013). Trends suggest that most economies will see an increase since migrants typically perform jobs that permit the economy to be more productive such as childcare and household services (Crawley, 2018). Migration has always been a highly debated political topic as it is a highly visible reflection of global inequalities (Crawley, 2018). An additional issue is that not everyone has the same access to the benefits of migration, and when individuals do migrate, they often find unequal access to rights and social resources in their new countries (Crawley, 2018). This is why we created Welcome Home. This app consolidates and provides search capabilities for several different services that a newcomer to Canada might need, such as refugee services, community centres and green spaces. The app allows users to search for services through several methods and provides information about the variety of services available to them. We wanted to create an app that would help people who are new to Canada in order to reduce the stress inherent in migration and to help welcome them to their new home.
