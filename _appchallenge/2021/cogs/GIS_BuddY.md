## Mission Statement

United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has listed 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for all countries, the 10th of which being to reduce inequality.

Often than not, inequality happens systematically in long run which diminishes the ability to obtain living resources of various kinds for certain groups of people. To fight it, one should also think more about sustainable approaches.

Education or training has always been a way for people with little resources to cultivate their future and change from their current situations. However, traditional education might not be adequate, especially for those who could not access schooling in the assumed ages.

According to UN, upon hard time, some groups are more vulnerable than others to be negatively impacted. Examples are senior-aged people, children, women, and physically-challenged people.

Our GIS web app - EqualNS, aims to provide information of education and training resources for the groups mentioned above. In addition, users could also find relevant demographic and social-economic statistics that will help them to find where the most suitable education resource is.
