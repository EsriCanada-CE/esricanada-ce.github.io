    bio: "I am a fourth year student completing a combined honours in Environmental Science and Environment, Sustainability, and Society at Dalhousie University. I am passionate about protecting the environment, and how we can re-establish our connection with the natural world. I believe GIS is a fantastic tool for making the outdoors accessible, highlighting inequalities in access to green space, and connecting technology with natural sciences through nature interpretation."

## Mission Statement

The outdoors are for everyone. Needing a car to spend time in nature is outdated and wrong. Spending time and being active outdoors is known to reduce the risk of diseases like heart diseases, mental illness, and even cancer. See the UN article on the importance reducing inequalities in access to green space [here](https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/green-spaces-invaluable-resource-delivering-sustainable-urban-health). Unfortunately, systemically disadvantaged people like minority groups do not have the access they need because urban greenspaces are mostly in wealthy neighborhoods, and you need a car to visit hiking trails outside of the city. If you do not have a car, you may also not know about the natural spaces that are available. The Halifax Regional Municipality has many parks and greenspaces to choose from! We want to get you there. Using transit and biking systems already in place, you can use this application to discover new greenspaces and find the best way to get there.
