  - name: "Meg MacKay"
    bio: "Meg is a fifth-year student at Dalhousie University, majoring in environmental science. Meg spent her undergrad learning about some of her varied interests (and switching programs a couple times!), from journalism, to sustainability, to geography. She has got a new-found passion for spatial information and is especially interested in how geographic information science and technology can be used to look at social and environmental issues. This year’s theme for the ESRI App Challenge allowed her to explore just that!"
  - name: "Sage Mosgrove"
    bio: "Sage is a 4th year undergraduate student from Dalhousie University, studying environmental science and economics. She is an interdisciplinary student with interests in food system sustainability, ecological economics, and geographic information science. After graduation, Sage hopes to have a relaxing summer before taking on a research-based Master of Environmental Studies Degree, using her GIS knowledge to address issues of food system sustainability and development in Canada."
  - name: "Mariah St Pierre"
    bio: "Mariah is a fifth-year student at Dalhousie University working towards a BSc in Environmental Science, a minor in Statistics, certificates in GIS and EIA with co-op option. She has grown her passion for environmental justice, physical geography and spatial analysis through various courses and work terms while at Dal. She is currently employed with Northern Affairs Canada in renewable energy programming for northern remote communities and hopes to join full-time after her graduation this spring. Mariah is considering a Masters of Geodesy and Geomatic Engineering at UNB in the coming years but hopes to gain some real-world work."

## Mission statement

In today’s world, gender equality, income equality and women’s empowerment are rising issues that have impacts across all facets of life. Naturally, there is a spatial component to the barriers that these populations face. Important factors like where facilities are located, for example, can greatly impact quality of life. Our team has chosen to address gender inequality in low-income neighbourhoods by specifically looking at income levels of single-mother families and their geospatial access to health and family wellness services. In general, low-income neighbourhoods have disproportionately lower access to services and healthy environments in part due to where the health facilities are located and the means of transportation to get to them. As it is often women who take on the role of primary caretaker for children, this web application will help determine the extent to which health and family wellness services in the Halifax Regional Municipality are accessible to low-income single mothers. Further, our map will be used to determine the spatial gaps that cause these inequalities and potentially help in decision-making when considering where to put a new facility.
