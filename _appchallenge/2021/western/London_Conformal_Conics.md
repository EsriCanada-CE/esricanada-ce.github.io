## App Information

This app follows the targets and indicators of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s) [Goal 10](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10) – reducing income inequality, to examine patterns of income inequality in Canada. Specifically, this app shows census subdivisions in Canada that have grown less than the national average in median income from 2001-2016, prior to the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals. This app is presented in the style of a dashboard, where the web map featured on the right displays census subdivisions, bordered by supplementary features and information like infographics and charts that users can view and interact with to learn about economic growth and income inequality in Canada.
