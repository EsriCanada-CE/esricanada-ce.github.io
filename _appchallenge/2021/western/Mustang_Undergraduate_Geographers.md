## Mission statement

The Sustainable Development Goal 10 is about reduced inequality. Canada is an immigrant country that welcomes hundreds of thousands of new immigrants and refugees every year, where the city of London is also one of the destinations, they will consider landing on (Target 10.7). It may be possible that they feel excluded due to being minorities (Target 10.2). While the governments and volunteers provide packages of fiscal and social support to them, the information is sparse on the internet where the target audiences may not know where to start at all (Target 10.4). We believe that it is necessary to have a one-stop portal for the new settlers to gain information about social support services they might need before and after they land on London.
