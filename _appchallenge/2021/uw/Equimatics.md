## Equimatics - Food Desert Solver

- “Food deserts” have emerged over the past 20 years as spaces of concern for communities, public health authorities and researchers because of their potential negative impact on dietary quality and subsequent health outcomes.
- Food deserts are residential geographic spaces, typically in urban settings, where low-income residents have limited or no access to retail food establishments with sufficient variety at an affordable cost.
- Research on food deserts presents methodological challenges including retail food store identification and classification, identification of low-income populations, and transportation and proximity metrics.
- Furthermore, the complex methods often used in food desert research can be difficult to reproduce and communicate to key stakeholders.
- To address these challenges, we introduce Food Desert Solver. The goal of our web application is to help the government and residents identify food deserts collectively and generate a central optimal location for new grocery store establishments.
