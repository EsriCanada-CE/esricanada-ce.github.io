## Mission Statement

The Web App, built with ArcGIS Experience Builder, intends to highlight the environmental racism experienced by Indigenous communities living on reserves in the territory now known as Ontario.  “Environmental racism” is a term coined by Benjamin Chavis, a Black civil rights leader from the US.  He defined environmental racism as:

> Racial discrimination in environmental policy-making, the enforcement of regulations and laws, the deliberate
> targeting of communities of colour for toxic waste facilities, the official sanctioning of the life-threatening
> presence of poisons and pollutants in [racialized] communities, and the history of excluding people of colour
> from leadership of the ecology movements.

We hope that this app can serve as a starting point for further learning about this issue, and that it motivates individuals to hold their elected representatives to account.
