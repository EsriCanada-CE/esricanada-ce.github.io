## Mission Statement

Canada is considered one of the healthiest nations in the world, but this good health is not shared by all who reside within it. Despite being one of the youngest and fastest-growing groups<sup>1</sup>, our Indigenous population faces grave health inequalities. This includes a lower life expectancy by as much as 15 years, as well as higher rates of infant mortality, suicide, hospitalizations due to mental illness, chronic illnesses, and infectious diseases<sup>2</sup>. The health inequalities experienced have primarily been a result of settler colonialism which displaced First Nations to remote communities that lack resources, amongst other detriments<sup>3</sup>.

The Waterloo Health Organization aims to respond to this inequality through our application NOOJIMO.  Derived from the Objibwen word for healing<sup>4</sup>, our application takes a holistic approach that incorporates both indigenous and western perspectives on health. With NOOJIMO residents within indigenous communities can more easily access health services and other associated facilities. Nearby health amenities - including hospitals, mental health clinics, healing lodges, and community centres - can be identified based on a user’s location. Once the desired amenity has been identified, directions and estimated travel times are provided. Beyond its benefits to individuals, NOOJIMO can also be used by planners or governing authorities to identify areas with insufficient access to health care, which can in turn inform responsive programs or policy development.

Through our application, the Waterloo Health Organization aims to support the United Nations’ objective of [reducing inequality](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2020/goal-10/) in its various forms as well as to respond to the [Calls to Action](http://trc.ca/assets/pdf/Calls_to_Action_English2.pdf) identified by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada.
