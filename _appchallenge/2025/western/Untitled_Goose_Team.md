    bio: "(Left) Hi everyone, my name is Haorui, and I am an international student from China. I’m a first-year master’s student at Western University in the Department of Geography and Environment. My research focuses on using aggregated and de-identified cellular device mobility data to study the modes of transportation people use to commute to work, as well as how external factors, such as weather and employer policies, affect commuting volume and choices. In my free time, I’m building a race car with Western Formula Racing, and I’m also a pilot."
  - name: "James Brackett"
    bio: "(Middle) Hello! I’m currently in my final semester at Western University pursuing an Honours BSc in Geographic Information Science. I am excited to graduate this spring and potentially begin my post-graduate studies in the fall where I would be mapping moose winter habitat in northern Ontario. Remote sensing is the sub-discipline of geography that most interests me, and I have completed summer internships in the past involving the applications of remote sensing in precision agriculture. If I’m not in the lab working on GIS projects, I’m probably at home also working on GIS projects."
  - name: "Alex Logan"
    bio: "(Right) Hey everyone, I’m a fourth-year student at Western University, set to graduate this spring with a BA in Geography and Environment, along with a certificate in GIS. Next year, I will be starting my B.Ed. at Trent University. Over the past few years, I’ve developed a passion for GIS and look forward to applying my expertise to teaching high school geomatics courses."

## Mission Statement

Toronto offers a diverse array of rapid transit options that empower residents to travel efficiently across the city. This project seeks to rigorously examine the relationship between the walking distance to rapid transit stations and the frequency of transit use in Toronto. Drawing on the methodologies and insights of El‑Geneidy et al. (2014), which emphasize the importance of accurately delineating walking catchment areas to identify gaps and redundancies in transit service, as well as Hao and Peng (2023), who document nonlinear and threshold effects of bus stop proximity on transit use and carbon emissions in developing cities, our study will extend these frameworks to the Toronto context (El-Geneidy et al., 2014; Hao & Peng, 2022).

As the cost of living escalates, a growing number of individuals and families are increasingly dependent on public transit to mitigate transportation expenses. By analyzing how the proximity of transit stations influences ridership patterns, our research aims to provide critical insights into improving transit accessibility—thereby alleviating financial burdens for transit-dependent households—and contribute to the sustainable urban mobility agenda.
