## Mission Statement

The goal of this project is to provide a visual representation of the cost of living compared to the median income throughout various locations in Alberta in a manner that is clear, accurate, and easy to interpret for individuals that do not have prior knowledge on the topic. The intention behind this is to convey the varying yearly costs of different necessities that an individual would purchase throughout the year, and compare it to the median income observed in the same location. This allows for a comprehensive overview of which areas are affordable and unaffordable within the province of Alberta.
