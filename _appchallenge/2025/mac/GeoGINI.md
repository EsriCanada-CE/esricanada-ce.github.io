    bio: "(Right) I recently graduated from McMaster University in the Honours Environmental Science program with a focus in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). I am passionate about GIS because of its ability to solve complex challenges at different scales, such as natural disasters. Outside of my academic work, I love learning how to garden, rock climbing with friends, and enjoying walks with my family."

## Mission Statement

Affordability is a critical topic in todays economic climate. When we think of affordability, many of us would think of housing. Today the housing market is reaching unprecidented rates, because of this, people often look for solutions. This process can lead to gentrification, a process that by definition is taking away from affordable housing that is lacking in the current housing options. This causes displacement of low-income and vulnreble populations. Our mission is to inform people about gentrification and its influence on affordable housing, while providing an index through our app, HomeInsight, communicating dissemination areas in the GTA at greater risk of gentrification. Communicating a quantification of gentrification has ethical risks, to mitigate this, our goal is to provide actionables for those accessing our app, providing information about how to comminicate with local elected officials to, to policy intruments for mitigating displacement and advocating for affordable housing discussed in the app.
