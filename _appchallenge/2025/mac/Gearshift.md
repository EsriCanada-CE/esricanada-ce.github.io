    bio: "I am currently in my final year for Environment and Society, concurrently pursuing a certificate in GIS. My current work primarily focuses on using GIS in both archaeological and urban planning contexts; with my recent obsession being learning how to use Blender and GIS to recreate ancient landscapes! It was incredibly rewarding to compete again in the ECCE App challenge; especially with the theme being in economic sustainability. When I’m not fangirling over John Nelson or finding a job, I’m figuring out which bubble tea shop has the best passionfruit-green tea in Hamilton."

    bio: "I’m in my fourth and final year at Mac for Biodiversity and Environmental Sciences, pursuing a certificate in the GISciences! It’s been such a blast being able to participate in the ECCE App challenges, and I’m very grateful for the opportunities to apply everything I’ve learnt into tangible, real-world solutions. As I continue to expand my skill sets in GIS, I hope to contribute my efforts towards mapping the trends in biodiversity and climate, especially with these two being such hot topics in context to the Canadian landscape! Besides spending half of the day looking for cool-looking maps to emulate, I spend the other half chalked up at my local bouldering gym, or top-roping by the Niagara Escarpment."

  - name: "Zehui Yin"
    bio: "I am a Geography PhD student and research assistant at TransLAB (Transportation Research Lab) within the School of Earth, Environment & Society at McMaster University, working under the guidance of Dr. Darren Scott. My current research focuses on utilizing data and quantitative methods to study public transit and shared micromobility, including bike share and shared e-scooters, in North America, with a particular emphasis on Hamilton, Ontario. I obtained an Honours Bachelor of Arts (HBA) Degree from the University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC) in 2024, majoring in Economics for Management Studies, with minors in Geographic Information Science (GIS) and Applied Statistics, and a certificate in Computational Social Science."

## Mission Statement

Toronto stands at a crossroads. With rising energy costs and growing congestion straining our transportation systems, we need smarter solutions that move people—not just vehicles. Gearshift provides urban planners with an advanced geospatial platform to transform Toronto's mobility infrastructure, using data-driven insights to optimize transit networks, pinpoint where bike lanes are needed most, and create truly interconnected communities, both centrally, and regionally. By visualizing infrastructure gaps and simulating improvements, we're helping build a city resilient to both energy market and population fluctuations and by making the right way to move also the easiest way. We believe in a future where seamless public transit, and safe biking networks, make short trips affordable, efficient, and enjoyable—positioning Toronto as a world-class city where people, not cars, come first.
