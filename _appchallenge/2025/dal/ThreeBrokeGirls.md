## Mission Statement

Shopping local is something Canadians are increasingly encouraged to do, but it can be overwhelming to research where to go for all your needs when using traditional mapping apps and search engines. Our app, Support Local Halifax, uses open data to highlight local businesses and green transportation route options of Halifax to help users make more sustainable shopping decisions. Canadians have recently been under more pressure to buy local as geopolitical tensions grow between us and our closest trading partner. Furthermore, shopping local can help reduce the carbon footprint associated with manufacturing and shipping goods over long distances. It may also aid in reducing the exploitation of more vulnerable ecosystems and communities that do not have the same environmental or labour protections as Canadians are privileged with. We hope that users will turn to our app to find a store for their needs and then utilize the swiping feature to view bus and bike routes as alternatives to driving.
