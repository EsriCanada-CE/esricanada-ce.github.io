## Mission Statement

Our mission is to create a data-driven mapping tool that seamlessly integrates housing affordability with carbon footprint insights. We aim to empower not only policymakers and urban planners but also the public - especially those looking to live more sustainably and within their means but unsure where to start. By analyzing average household income, average rent per neighborhood, and affordability thresholds alongside environmental and transportation data, our app provides actionable insights to:
       
    1. Illuminate challenges: Clearly identify how housing costs and carbon emissions interact, helping users understand local urban stress points.
   
    2. Drive Informed Decisions: Equip decision-makers with transparent, data-backed intelligence to foster equitable housing policies and promote sustainable transportation solutions.
       
    3. Empower the Public: Offer a user-friendly platform for community members who want to transition to a sustainable lifestyle, enabling them to discover affordable neighborhoods that align with their eco-conscious goals.
