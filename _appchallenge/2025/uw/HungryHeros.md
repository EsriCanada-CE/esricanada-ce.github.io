    bio: "I am a fourth-year Urban Planning student at the University of Waterloo with a GIS specialization. Having grown up in three different countries, I gained exposure to different urban environments and learned to appreciate all the unique things that make up communities. My love for problem solving led to an interest in GIS and Iâ€™ve been at it ever since! Outside of school, I love reading and taking walks."

    bio: "I am a third-year Urban Planning student at the University of Waterloo, specializing in GIS and its application in studying urban issues. Born and raised in Hong Kong, I have experienced life in a dense and highly efficient city, shaping my passion for urban development, transportation, and land use planning. My academic and professional experiences have focused on using spatial analysis and data-driven approaches to address urban challenges. During my time with the Environmental Protection Department in Hong Kong, I worked on air pollution modeling, applying GIS and machine learning techniques to analyze environmental data. I am particularly interested in sustainable mobility, public transit, and active transportation, aiming to contribute to the creation of more efficient, livable, and well-connected cities."

    bio: "I am currently a first-year Masters student at the University of Waterloo, on my way to obtain an MES in Geography. I completed my undergraduate degree at UW in Planning where I specialized in GIS and environmental land management alongside being an ECCE member. I was born in Hamilton but moved around a lot as a kid, giving way to my passion for urban design, regional planning, and mapping. On the side, I love completing puzzles, playing video games and playing with my cats."

## Mission Statement

The Harvest app seeks to enhance food security in Kitchener by providing essential information on accessible and affordable means of accessing fresh food including community gardens, foraging and urban trees. Our platform maps existing community gardens, offering residents easy access to fresh produce and shared green spaces. We also showcase Kitchener's urban tree inventory, highlighting fruit-bearing trees that contribute to local food sources. Additionally, we identify underutilized lots that can be transformed into productive, sustainable food sources. The public, urban planners and organizations can utilize this information to improve local food systems and affordability.
