# Urth-Routes Mission Statement

Urth-Route is a navigation app focused on sustainable solutions to transportation by promoting
the use of alternate transportation modes to stay healthy and reduce your carbon footprint. By
informing users of their estimated emissions released for their trip, users can reflect on their
contribution to their carbon footprint and climate change.

We encourage the use of alternative transportation modes such as walking, running, and
cycling, which release zero emissions. By showing the convenience and accessibility of biking
with the inclusion of Community Access Bikeshare stations and bicycle parking locations across
the region of Waterloo, communities can be empowered to have active and greener lifestyles.
