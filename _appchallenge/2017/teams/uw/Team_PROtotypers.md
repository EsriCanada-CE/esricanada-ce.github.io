    bio: "My name is Martin Holicka, and I am a 3rd year Geomatics student at the University of Waterloo. I am passionate about solving problems and optimizing the solutions. I specialize in statistics-based spatial analysis and have had very successful projects in the past, most notably optimizing patrol routes of regional police cruisers with an average decrease in both time and distance travelled by more than 55%. Outside of school, I enjoy endurance mountain biking, triathlons, and skiing. I am looking forward to the challenges of the 2017 ECCE App Challenge."

# Mission Statement

This application allows a user to find the nearest safe bike lockup area from a recreational facility in the city of Waterloo. With a way to easily find the closest safe bike lockup area to reduce the risk of a cyclist's bike being stolen, Team PROtotypers hopes to increase ridership and use of sustainable transportation methods.
