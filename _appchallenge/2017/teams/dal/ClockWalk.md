### Mission Statement

Our app features 5 different types of vehicles: midsize, fullsize, plussized, compact, and hybrid; all vehicles found and driven within Canada. Using the Greater Toronto Area, our app will be able to allow the user to see the different CO2 emissions emitted from these 5 subcategories when entering a desired start and end location. This is accomplished through a set of calculations that takes the distance multiplied by an average CO2 emittance per that subcategory to allow the user to see how much Kg/m of CO2 they emit.
