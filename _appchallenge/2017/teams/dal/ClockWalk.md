### Mission Statement

The Vancouver Clock Walk fosters sustainable active living through urban exploration.

Our app, is designed to encourage people to go out and explore their city
through sustainable non-motorized transportation. The app works by showing
people how far they can walk from their current position based on a set time and
includes interesting nearby locations. By encouraging people to get outside and
learn about their community in small manageable stretches of time, our app not
only promotes active living but demonstrates how easy it is to move around the
city without motorized transportation.
