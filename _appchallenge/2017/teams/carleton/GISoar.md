### Mission Statement

> An app that aims to help people reduce their carbon footprint through travel

Humans have become the main cause of change for Earth’s atmospheric composition and thus are the drive for future climate change. The principal force on climate is increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuel emissions, much of which can remain in the atmosphere for millenniums. On an individual basis, many feel helpless such that the changes they make do not have a large enough impact to help re-navigate the direction that climate change is headed towards. This app will allow people to make a ‘greener’ choice when travelling and can further propagate airlines to create more sustainable practices for travel as the demand increases. As the individual demand increases for more sustainable options, the larger companies will begin to reorient their practices to fuel, engines and planes that are more efficient. This app could help build the basis for the push forward that companies need to help make our everyday lives more sustainable.
