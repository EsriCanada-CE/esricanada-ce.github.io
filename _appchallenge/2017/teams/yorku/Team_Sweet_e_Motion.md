## Mission Statement

Deteriorating transportation infrastructure has become a major issue in aging cities, and this significantly complicates urban planning procedures.  For developing and maintaining a logistically, socially, and environmentally sustainable transportation system, it is essential to have an accurate and up-to-date knowledge of hazards within the system (e.g., dangerous road conditions, speeding issues, etc.).  This information is important to have for pedestrians, cyclists, drivers, and public transit users to ensure accessibility of urban areas.

Unfortunately, the costs of obtaining such accurate data ongoingly can be quite prohibitive, and collecting the data can be logistically challenging.  Furthermore, it can be difficult for data collectors to observe more subtle systematic defects in a transportation system.  It is therefore desirable to crowd-source traffic hazard information.  

Our application seeks to satisfy this need to gather and analyze traffic hazard data ongoingly.  As such, our goal is to provide the public with a means to report traffic hazards to city officials, and to provide urban planning experts with a means of intuitively organizing and analyzing this crowd-sourced information.
