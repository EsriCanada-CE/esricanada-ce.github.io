    bio: "I‚Äôm a 4th year Geomatics engineering student at York University, Lassonde school of Engineering. I have specialized skills in variety of areas, such as remote sensing, image processing, GIS, surveying, etc. Despite the fact that I‚Äôm not a software developer, I have some software developing experience using Java and MATLAB. I have a strong background in theoretical understanding of geographical information system and further related fields. I have work experience from Natural Resources Canada ‚Äì Surveyor General Branch and Ministry of Transportation as a geomatics plan technician. Hence, I have experience in researching, producing and maintaining engineering and title records. Furthermore, I‚Äôve generated and assessed engineering survey products using specialized computer software, drafting techniques and GIS tools and software."

    bio: "I am a 4th year Geomatics Engineering student at Lassonde School of Engineering, York University. Presently I am working as a research assistant in the Petrie Science and Engineering lab to delineate individual tree crowns in order to identify the spread of the Emerald Ash Borer infestation. As an engineering student, I have proficiencies in software development, surveying, GIS, remote sensing, computer vision, and physical and space geodesy. Having worked in research, I plan on continuing my academic endeavors as a graduate student. In my spare time, I enjoy reading and programming. My non-academic interests include philosophy, economics and sports."

# Smart Transport Mission Statement
Smart transportation is an application that shows the user his/her carbon emissions for a car trip.
The core purpose of the app is to enable the user to become more aware of the carbon footprint produced
by his/her daily commute. It is estimated that a single passenger produces up to 4.7 metric tons of ùê∂ùëÇ2
emission per year, which is detrimental to the environment and threatens its long term sustainability. By
illustrating to the user his/her daily contribution to the net carbon emissions produced per year, the team
aims to bring more awareness to this issue and hopes to encourage the user to consider more eco-friendly
means of transportation.

The application includes several different features that make it usable for a more universal
audience. The application interface starts off by showing the traffic conditions in the city of Toronto and
subsequently provides the user with a widget to plan his/her trip. The widget shows the user the travel
distance from his/her initial destination to final destination. Consequently by visualizing the traffic layer
the user can also examine the traffic conditions along the planned route.

By accessing a car model widget the user can further determine the fuel required for the trip, by
initially determining the fuel economy of their respective car model. The widget includes car models from
year 2000 to year 2017. Using the estimated fuel economy the user can then proceed to the Carbon Footprint
calculator widget which allows the user to estimate his/her carbon footprint for the planned trip. Through
awareness of their carbon footprint, the user can then consider alternate means of transportation or in
general become more considerate towards their daily usage of vehicles with high carbon emissions.
