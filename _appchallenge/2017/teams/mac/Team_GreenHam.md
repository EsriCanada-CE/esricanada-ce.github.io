### Mission Statement

The mission of E-Range is to promote the validity of sustainable transportation to both current and future vehicle owners in Canada. We strive to advocate for the use of battery powered vehicles not only in urban areas, but to all corners of the province. Our goal is to encourage the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by allowing users to see the potential for electric vehicles in their area. Our focus on Canada is based on the country being one of the worldâ€™s largest per capita greenhouse gas emitters. This, linked with an expanding electric car market make E-Range a valid resource for achieving sustainable transportation.
