### Mission Statement

Student Commute is dedicated to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by increasing ride share to and from post-secondary institutions.

This app is for students commuting to and from a post-secondary school. These students share a way of life. This commonality between commuters allows for a sense of familiarity that students will be more comfortable with and will reduce the number of cars on the road, travelling from and to these destinations.
