  - name: Sean Leipe
    bio: "(left) I'm a 4th year student in the Honours Earth and Environmental Science program at McMaster University, with a minor in GIS. I've been working on my undergraduate thesis with Patrick DeLuca, which involves evaluating susceptibility to badland encroachment in Italy using GIS and multicriteria evaluation. My main research interests at the moment are integrating traditional earth science work such as hydrogeology, geophysics, and geomorphology with GIS as I enjoy working in both fields and believe each adds value to the other when they are combined."

### Purpose

To compliment the [Bike Share](https://www.bikesharetoronto.com/) program present in the City of Toronto by determining routes between bike hubs using only bike-friendly routes (no highways). As of the 24th of March, the [bike share website](https://member.bikesharetoronto.com/stations) only displays available hubs.

In particular, the app will display all available bike hubs, where the user will select the start and end hubs, have a route automatically generated on bike-friendly paths giving higher priority to bikeways, and display the distance of the generated route.
